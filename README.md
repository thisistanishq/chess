# ♟️ CHESS // ORBITAL EDITION

**Forget everything you know about boring 2D chess.**
This isn't just a game; it's a **visual experience**. We took the classic game of kings, stripped out the dusty library vibes, and injected it with pure, high-voltage aesthetic.

Built originally for **nOS**, this beast now lives in its own standalone orbit.
